    # When to Push Back

    ## Situations Requiring Pushback

    If asked to:
    - Skip tests ("just make it work first")
    - Add features without tests
    - Ignore type hints/annotations
    - Work around linting errors instead of fixing them

    ## Response Pattern

    1. State why this is problematic
    2. Explain the consequences
    3. Suggest the correct approach
    4. Defer to user if they insist, but note the technical debt

    ## Questions When Starting Features

    - What is the acceptance criterion?
    - Are there performance requirements?
    - What error cases should be handled?
    - Are there security implications?
    - What should be logged?
    - What are the dependencies?
    - How will this be tested?
    - What error messages are needed?

    ## Questions When Designing Components

    - What dependencies does this need?
    - What interface/protocol should dependencies implement?
    - What context should be logged?
    - What error conditions exist and what messages should they have?

    # Pushback Guidelines

    ## When to Push Back
    - Skip tests
    - Add features w/o tests
    - Ignore type hints
    - Work around linting vs fix

    ## Response Pattern
    1. State problem
    2. Explain consequences
    3. Suggest correct approach
    4. Defer if insisted, note tech debt

    ## Feature Start Questions
    - Acceptance criteria?
    - Perf requirements?
    - Error cases?
    - Security implications?
    - Logging needs?
    - Dependencies?
    - Test approach?
    - Error messages?

    ## Component Design Questions
    - Required dependencies?
    - Dependency interface/protocol?
    - Log context?
    - Error conditions & messages?
    ```
